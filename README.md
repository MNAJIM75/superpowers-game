## Changes in this fork

### New features :
 - Post-processing on camera
 - [Add BMFont compatibility](https://github.com/Togimaro/superpowers-game-bmfont-plugin)
 - Default value detection for Behavior with initializer evaluation
 - Beta GLTF v2 import
 - Blendmodes support on SpriteRenderer (include Alpha Blending, Multiply, Additive, Screen, Substract, Erase, Darken, Lighten)
 - Add an error log panel on shader editor, expose sprite opacity to shaders and add a new default shader with color, opacity, alpha-testing and alpha-premultiplication taken into account

### Breaking change :
 - Update Three.js to r94, many plugins need some minor adjustement & type disambiguation
 - Precompile-script branch merged (cf https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game/commits/precompile-scripts). Most plugins need to be updated
 - The shaders are no longer treated as always transparent. The alpha-testing need to be taken into account now (cf default shader)
 - Same thing with the alpha premultiplication

## Roadmap / Ideas :
 - Improve Sup.Text performance & add more rendering options
 - Improve Behavior Editor: add more types (ie Array, simple interface) & Component reference
 - Add prefab override
 - Add skybox/background color picker in editor & at runtime
 - Add more 3d model importer: fbx, blend?
 - Add layer rendering on camera
 - Add pixel-perfect camera
 - 9 Sliced sprite
 - Animated tilemap
 - Test FMOD integration
