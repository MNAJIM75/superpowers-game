## Changes

### New features :
 - Post-processing on camera
 - [Add BMFont compatibility](https://github.com/Togimaro/superpowers-game-bmfont-plugin)
 - Basic default value detection for Behavior (work-in-progress, has some quirks)

### Breaking change :
 - Update Three.js to r92, many plugins need some minor adjustement & type disambiguation

### Roadmap / Ideas :
 - Improve Sup.Text performance & add more rendering options
 - Improve Behavior: better default value detection (add expression evaluation) & more types (ie Array, simple interface)
 - Add more 3d model importer: gltf2, fbx, obj?
 - Add pixel-perfect camera
 - 9 Sliced sprite
 - Animated tilemap
 - Test FMOD integration
